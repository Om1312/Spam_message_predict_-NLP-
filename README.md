 📩 Spam Message Classifier (Streamlit App)

This project is a **Spam Classification Web App** built using  
**Machine Learning (Random Forest), TF-IDF Vectorization, and Streamlit**.

Users can enter a **preprocessed text message**, and the model will predict:
- **Spam (1)**
- **Not Spam (0)**

---

## 🚀 Features
- Uses **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical features
- **RandomForestClassifier** for spam detection
- Entire ML pipeline saved in a single `.pkl` file
- Clean and simple **Streamlit UI**
- Built by **Om Laxman Khairnar**

---

## 🧠 Model Pipeline
The pipeline consists of:
1. **TfidfVectorizer** – converts text to numerical vectors  
2. **RandomForestClassifier** – predicts whether a message is spam
